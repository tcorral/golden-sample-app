# Task: [AIDER] Locale Selector Component Doesn't Change Language in Angular NX Monorepo

## Description
**Problem**
The app-locale-selector component is supposed to update the application's locale when a language is selected, but it does not work. Clicking a language in the dropdown does nothing—the UI does not update, and the selected locale is not applied.

**Current Behavior**
* The dropdown displays available languages.
* Clicking a language does not update the app’s locale.
* No errors appear in the console.
* The locale stored in bb-locale does not seem to take effect.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Expected Behavior**
1. Clicking the locale selector should display the list of available languages.
2. Selecting a language should:
    * Set the locale in the bb-locale cookie.
    * Update the UI to reflect the chosen language.
    * Ensure the selected locale appears in the dropdown.
3. The page should reload with the correct locale applied.

Please implement the necessary changes to address this issue.
