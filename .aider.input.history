+PROBLEM: Problem The app-locale-selector component is supposed to update the application's locale when a language is selected, but it does not work. Clicking a language in the dropdown does nothing—the UI does not update, and the selected locale is not applied. Current Behavior * The dropdown displays available languages. * Clicking a language does not update the app’s locale. * No errors appear in the console. * The locale stored in bb-locale does not seem to take effect.  | BEHAVIOR: Expected Behavior 1. Clicking the locale selector should display the list of available languages. 2. Selecting a language should: * Set the locale in the bb-locale cookie. * Update the UI to reflect the chosen language. * Ensure the selected locale appears in the dropdown. 3. The page should reload with the correct locale applied.  | FILES:  | REQUIREMENTS: Implement all fixes in one pass following Angular best practices, update tests, ensure cookie handling works cross-browser
