+Problem

# 2025-03-07 15:21:44.132906
+The app-locale-selector component is supposed to update the application's locale when a language is selected, but it does not work. Clicking a language in the dropdown does nothing—the UI does not update, and the selected locale is not applied.

+Current Behavior

# 2025-03-07 15:22:01.958835
+The dropdown displays available languages.

+Clicking a language does not update the app’s locale.

# 2025-03-07 15:22:32.514715
+No errors appear in the console.

+The locale stored in bb-locale does not seem to take effect.

+######## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ########

# 2025-03-07 15:24:03.931665
+Expected Behavior 1. Clicking the locale selector should display the list of available languages. 2. Selecting a language should: * Set the locale in the bb-locale cookie. * Update the UI to reflect the chosen language. * Ensure the selected locale appears in the dropdown. 3. The page should reload with the correct locale applied.
