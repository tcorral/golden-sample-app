Clicking a language in the dropdown does nothing\u2014the UI does not update, and the selected locale is not applied.\n\n**Current Behavior**\n* The dropdown displays available languages.\n* Clicking a language does not update the app\u2019s locale.\n* No errors appear in the console.\n* The locale stored in bb-locale does not seem to take effect.", "acceptance_criteria": "**Expected Behavior**\n1. Clicking the locale selector should display the list of available languages.\n2. Selecting a language should:\n    * Set the locale in the bb-locale cookie.\n    * Update the UI to reflect the chosen language.\n    * Ensure the selected locale appears in the dropdown.\n3. The page should reload with the correct locale applied."}
